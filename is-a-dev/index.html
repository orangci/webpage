      <h1>Server Rules</h1>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Follow Discord's<a target="_blank" href="https://discord.com/terms">
            ToS</a
          >
          and
          <a target="_blank" href="https://discord.com/guidelines"
            >Community Guidelines</a
          >.
        </li>
        <li>
          Show human decency and use common sense above all else. Keep our
          server clean and be respectful of others.
        </li>
        <ol>
          <li>
            No NSFW. This includes, images, discussions of anything on the topic
            or "funny" jokes, gore, role playing etc.
          </li>
          <li>
            Do not discuss mutes/bans/warnings etc in public chats (use a
            ticket.) They are for the member's own benefit and do not serve as a
            topic of discussion.
          </li>
          <li>
            Refrain from mini modding. You aren't a moderator; use
            <em>/report</em>
            or ping (<strong>one</strong>) staff member.
          </li>
          <li>No slurs, excessive swearing, abuse, bait, harassment, etc.</li>
        </ol>
        <li>Do not post malicious links and/or files.</li>
        <li>
          No attempting to bypass, intentionally misinterpret, or find loopholes
          in the rules.
        </li>
        <ol>
          <li>A moderator's word is final.&nbsp; When told to cease, cease.</li>
        </ol>
        <li>
          Refrain from asking for support in non-support channels; you will not
          receive help there. If you need help, then open a ticket in #⁠get-help
          only after you have read the is-a.dev documentation and weren't
          answered there.
        </li>
        <li>
          Do not beg for your pull request to be merged or for anything else.
          Send a link to your pull request
          <em>once</em>
          in #pull-requests and patiently wait for a maintainer to get to it. Do
          <em>not</em>
          ping maintainers to merge pull requests.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h1>Moderation Ethic</h1>
      <p>
        Before we can moderate anyone else, we must hold ourselves responsible
        for our own actions. We must hold ourselves to the strictest standards
        of all. Don’t mistake maintaining the server as a friendly and clean
        environment for being “strict”. The two are
        <em>not</em>
        mutually exclusive at
        <em>all</em>.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Key points</strong>:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Don’t allow yourself to show bias or prejudice. For example, don’t
          “let something slide” solely because the member in question is an old
          and respected person within the community. It is not harsh or wrong to
          call someone out and request somebody to cease something that isn’t
          allowed on the server and is detrimental.
        </li>
        <li>
          Don’t be rude. A problem I’ve noticed here is that some maintainers
          are rude to new members especially. It’s ridiculous and sets a
          horrible example.
        </li>
        <li>
          Don’t abuse your privileges. You were granted them for a reason -
          because we trusted you. Please don’t abuse that trust and use them for
          things they aren’t meant for,
          <span style="text-decoration: underline">
            <em>even as a joke</em> </span
          >. Simply put, it’s fair to nobody.
        </li>
        <li>
          Follow the rules. Especially regarding NSFW language and content,
          <em>please</em>.
        </li>
        <li>
          Staff are
          <strong>not</strong>
          immune to punishment, if you are caught breaking the rules, you will
          be punished, just like any other regular member.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h1>Staff Team Respect</h1>
      <p>
        Friends, this is a rather small community. Its purpose is to provide
        free subdomains for developers.
        <strong>This is not a power struggle. </strong>So relax.
      </p>
      <p>
        Be respectful to each other. Things like roles and positions do not and
        should not matter to anyone.
        <span style="text-decoration: underline"
          >Do not go complaining why {user} has {role} or why {user} has more
          permissions than you</span
        >. What matters is that the service and server runs peacefully, all this
        does is create drama.
      </p>
