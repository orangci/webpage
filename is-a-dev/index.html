      <strong>Introduction</strong>
    </h1>
    <p>
      This document is intended for new and existing staff members to cover
      what is and isn’t allowed in the server. Moderation and staff team
      respect is covered in this document.
    </p>
    <h1>Server Rules</h1>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Follow Discord's<a href="https://discord.com/terms"> ToS</a>
        and
        <a href="https://discord.com/guidelines">Community Guidelines</a>.
      </li>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Modified clients are allowed, however abusing them may result in a
          ban.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <li>
        Show human decency and use common sense above all else. Keep our
        server clean and be respectful of others.
      </li>
      <ol>
        <li>
          No NSFW. This includes, images, discussions of anything on the topic
          or "funny" jokes, gore, role playing etc.
        </li>
        <li>
          Do not discuss mutes, bans, warnings, or any related topics in
          public chats. They do not serve as a topic of discussion.
        </li>
        <li>
          Refrain from mini modding. You aren't a moderator; use
          <em>/report</em>
          or ping
          <span style="text-decoration: underline">one</span>
          staff member.
        </li>
        <li>No slurs, excessive swearing, abuse, bait, harassment, etc.</li>
      </ol>
      <li>Do not post malicious links and/or files.</li>
      <li>
        No attempting to bypass, intentionally misinterpret, or find loopholes
        in the rules.
      </li>
      <ol>
        <li>A moderator's word is final.&nbsp; When told to cease, cease.</li>
      </ol>
      <li>
        Refrain from asking for support in non-support channels; you will not
        receive help there. If you need help, then open a ticket in #⁠get-help
        only after you have read the is-a.dev documentation and weren't
        answered there.
      </li>
      <li>
        Do not beg for your pull request to be merged or for anything else.
        Send a link to your pull request
        <em>once</em>
        in #pull-requests and patiently wait for a maintainer to get to it. Do
        <em>not</em>
        ping maintainers to merge pull requests.
      </li>
      <li>Your account is your responsibility.</li>
      <ol>
        <li>
          If someone else is using your account and breaks these rules,
          <span style="text-decoration: underline">you are responsible</span>.
        </li>
        <li>
          If your account gets compromised and gets banned from this server,
          you may request an unban once you recover it.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <li>Do not attempt to bypass our auto moderation system.</li>
      <li>
        Do not advertise your website, bot or anything else outside of
        #showcase.
      </li>
      <ol>
        <li>Bot invite links are not allowed in #showcase.</li>
      </ol>
      <li>Do not attempt to bypass a punishment on your account.</li>
      <ol>
        <li>This will result in an immediate ban on your account.</li>
      </ol>
      <li>Do not ask for help outside of #help-forum.</li>
      <li>Do not use bot commands outside of #commands.</li>
    </ol>
    <h1>Moderation Ethic</h1>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Don't allow yourself to show bias or prejudice. For example, don't
        “let something slide” solely because the member in question is a
        respected person within the community. It is not harsh or wrong to
        call someone out and request somebody to cease something that isn't
        allowed on the server.
      </li>
      <li>
        Don't be rude. A problem that is fairly common in the server is that
        some maintainers are rude to new members. It's ridiculous and sets a
        horrible example.
      </li>
      <li>
        Don't abuse your privileges. You were granted them for a reason -
        because we trusted you. Please don't abuse that trust and use them for
        things they aren't meant for,
        <span style="text-decoration: underline">
          <em>even as a joke</em> </span>. Simply put, it's fair to nobody.
      </li>
      <li>
        Follow the rules. Especially regarding NSFW language and content.
      </li>
      <li>
        Staff are
        <span style="text-decoration: underline">not</span>
        immune to punishment. If you are caught breaking the rules, you will
        be punished, just like any other regular member.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h1>Staff Team Respect</h1>
    <p><strong>Being respectful to each other</strong>:</p>
    <p>
      We are working together, this is not a competition, so act like it.
      Everyone here should be mature enough to be able to at least respect
      each other, regardless of any differences or issues we have between us.
      If you have an issue with another staff member, take it to DMs, do not
      share your problems with the rest of the server.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Regarding roles and permissions</strong>:</p>
    <p>
      If someone receives a certain role or position that is higher than you,
      do not go complaining about it. We are old enough to talk it out
      properly and not have to argue. What matters is that the service and
      server runs peacefully, all this does is create drama.
    </p>
